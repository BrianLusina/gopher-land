# Bubble Sort

Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of n elements, write a function to sort the array

Approach

1. select the first element of the array
2. compare it with its next element
3. if it is larger than the next element then swap them, else do nothing
4. keep doing this for every index of the array
5. repeat the above process n times.

## Complexity

1. Time Complexity

    O(n^2) Worst case performance as we find the collection is in decreasing order

    O(n) Best-case performance, the list is already sorted

    O(n^2) Average performance

2. Space Complexity
    O(1) Worst case as we sort the collection in place and no new collection is used to store the sorted elements

## Founder's Name

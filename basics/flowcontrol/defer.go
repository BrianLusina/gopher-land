// A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.
// The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

// Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

package reorderroutes

// minReorder reorders the edges of the directed graph represented as an adjacency list in connections such that each vertex
// is connected and has a path to the first vertex marked with 0. n represents the number of vertices.
//
// Complexity:
// n is the number of vertices/nodes
//
// Time Complexity: O(n)
//     O(n) to initialize the adjacency list
//     The dfs function visits each node once, which takes O(n) time in total. Because we have undirected edges,
//     each edge can only be iterated twice (by nodes at the end), resulting in O(e) operations total while
//     visiting all nodes, where e is the number of edges. Because the given graph is a tree, there are nâˆ’1
//     undirected edges, so O(n+e)=O(n).
//
// Space Complexity: O(n)
//     Building the adjacency list takes O(n) space.
//     The recursion call stack used by dfs can have no more than n elements in the worst-case scenario.
//      It would take up O(n) space in that case.
//
// n: number of vertices or in this case, number of cities
// connections: adjacency matrix for a directed graph or in this case, representation of cities
// returns the minimum number of edges to re-arrange to ensure that each vertex is directly or indirectly connected to
// the initial vertex

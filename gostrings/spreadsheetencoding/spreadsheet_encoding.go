/*
spreadsheetEncodeColumn encodes a Spreadsheet column ID as an integer and returns it.
Here the encoding uses the alphabets A, B, C, etc. and
further uses the indexing of the alphabet starting from 1 like: A=1, B=2, C=3,..., Z=26
Complexity
Where n represents the number of characters in the column_id

- Time O(n) as we iterate over each character in the column ID to calculate the encoding
- Space O(1) no extra space is required to perform the encoding

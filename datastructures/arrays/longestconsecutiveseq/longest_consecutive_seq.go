// longestConsecutive returns the length longest consecutive sequence in a slice of integers
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while loop nested within the for loop, closer inspection reveals it to be linear.
// Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks the beginning of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in nums),
// the while loop can only run for nnn iterations throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm.
// This means that despite looking like O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n+n)=O(n) time.
// All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall runtime is linear.
// Space Complexity: O(n)
// In order to set up O(1) containment lookups, we allocate linear space for a hash table to store the O(n) numbers in nums.
